# FR3D #

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/BGSU-RNA/fr3d-python.png?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/BGSU-RNA/fr3d-python)

This is an implementation of the FR3D program in python.

To run the first time, navigate to the fr3d-python folder and run "python setup.py install"

fr3d-python requires pdbx to be installed, which you can get from PDB, for Python 2.7.  To run pdbx in Python 3.x, one can use the 2to3 tool from https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/2to3.html  The main changes are changing iterator.next() to next(iterator), xrange() to (range), print string to print(string), and exec _ to exec()
